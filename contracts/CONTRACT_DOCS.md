# 📋 VotingContract - Technical Documentation

## 📖 Overview

`VotingContract` is a smart contract developed in Solidity 0.8.19 that implements a transparent and secure voting system on the blockchain. It uses OpenZeppelin for security and access functionalities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Inheritance
- `Ownable`: Access control for administrative functions
- `ReentrancyGuard`: Protection against reentrancy attacks

### Key Features
- ✅ **Temporal elections**: With defined periods for candidacies and voting
- ✅ **Candidate system**: Registration and approval of candidates
- ✅ **Anonymous voting**: Using unique hashes per vote
- ✅ **Double vote prevention**: By address and by hash
- ✅ **Automatic counters**: For elections and candidates

## 📊 Data Structures

### Election Struct
```solidity
struct Election {
    uint256 id;           // Unique election ID
    string title;         // Election title
    uint256 startTime;    // Voting start timestamp
    uint256 candidacyEnd; // Candidacy end timestamp
    uint256 endTime;      // Voting end timestamp
    address creator;      // Creator address
    bool exists;          // Existence flag
}
```

### Candidate Struct
```solidity
struct Candidate {
    uint256 id;          // Unique candidate ID
    uint256 electionId;  // Election ID
    string name;         // Candidate name
    uint256 votes;       // Number of votes received
    bool approved;       // Approval status
    bool exists;         // Existence flag
}
```

## 🔧 Core Functions

### Administrative Functions

#### `createElection(string title, uint256 startTime, uint256 candidacyEnd, uint256 endTime)`
- **Access**: Public
- **Purpose**: Create a new election
- **Validations**:
  - Start time must be future
  - Candidacy end must be before start time
  - End time must be after start time
- **Events**: `ElectionCreated`

#### `approveCandidate(uint256 electionId, uint256 candidateId, string candidateName)`
- **Access**: Only election creator
- **Purpose**: Approve a candidate to participate
- **Validations**:
  - Only election creator can approve
  - Candidate must exist
  - Candidacy period must be active
- **Events**: `CandidateApproved`

### Public Functions

#### `registerCandidate(uint256 electionId)`
- **Access**: Public
- **Purpose**: Register a candidate (pre-approval)
- **Returns**: ID of created candidate
- **Validations**:
  - Election must exist
  - Candidacy period must be active

#### `vote(uint256 electionId, uint256 candidateId, string voteHash)`
- **Access**: Public (with ReentrancyGuard)
- **Purpose**: Cast a vote
- **Validations**:
  - Voting period must be active
  - Candidate must be approved
  - User must not have voted before
  - Vote hash must be unique
- **Events**: `VoteCast`

### View Functions

#### Election Queries
- `getElection(uint256 electionId)`: Complete election information
- `getTotalElections()`: Total elections created
- `getElectionCandidates(uint256 electionId)`: List of election candidates

#### Candidate Queries
- `getCandidate(uint256 candidateId)`: Complete candidate information
- `getTotalCandidates()`: Total candidates registered

#### Vote Queries
- `hasUserVoted(address voter, uint256 electionId)`: Check if user voted
- `isVoteHashUsed(string voteHash)`: Check if hash was used

## 📡 Events

### `ElectionCreated`
```solidity
event ElectionCreated(
    uint256 indexed electionId,
    string title,
    uint256 startTime,
    uint256 endTime
);
```

### `CandidateApproved` 
```solidity
event CandidateApproved(
    uint256 indexed electionId,
    uint256 indexed candidateId,
    string candidateName
);
```

### `VoteCast`
```solidity
event VoteCast(
    uint256 indexed electionId,
    uint256 indexed candidateId,
    address voter,
    string voteHash,
    uint256 totalVotesForCandidate
);
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Access Control
- **Election Creation**: Public (anyone can create elections)
- **Candidate Approval**: Only election creator
- **Voting**: Public during valid period

### Anti-Fraud Mechanisms
- **Double Voting Prevention**: Mapping `hasVoted[voter][electionId]`
- **Hash Uniqueness**: Mapping `usedVoteHashes[hash]`
- **Time Validation**: Validation of candidacy and voting periods
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Modifier on `vote` function

### Data Integrity  
- **Immutable Votes**: Votes cannot be modified once cast
- **Transparent Counting**: Public and verifiable counters
- **Event Logging**: All critical events are logged

## ⚡ Gas Optimization

### Efficient Storage
- Use of `mapping` for O(1) access
- OpenZeppelin `Counters` for secure IDs
- Optimized structs for storage slots

### Batch Operations
- Candidate arrays are built dynamically
- Minimum number of storage operations per transaction

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Test Categories
1. **Election Creation**
   - Temporal parameter validation
   - Creation permissions
   
2. **Candidate Management**
   - Candidate registration
   - Approval process
   - Permission validations
   
3. **Voting Process**
   - Valid vote casting
   - Double vote prevention
   - Unique hash validation

### Test Results
```
✅ 7 tests passing
⏱️ Average execution time: 559ms
🛡️ All security validations tested
```

## 📈 Deployment Stats

### Gas Usage (Polygon Amoy)
- **Contract Deployment**: ~2.5M gas
- **Create Election**: ~200K gas  
- **Register Candidate**: ~120K gas
- **Approve Candidate**: ~100K gas
- **Vote**: ~150K gas

### Network Compatibility
- ✅ Polygon Mainnet (Chain ID: 137)
- ✅ Polygon Amoy (Chain ID: 80002)
- ✅ Ethereum (with gas adjustments)

## 🔗 Integration

### Frontend Integration
- ABI available in `contracts/abi.json`
- Indexed events for efficient queries
- View functions for gasless state queries

### Backend Integration

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Configure ALCHEMY_RPC_URL and PRIVATE_KEY_OWNER
   ```

2. **Deploy Contract**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:amoy
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   npm run verify:amoy
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- **Private Keys**: Never commit private keys
- **Gas Limits**: Monitor limits in complex transactions
- **Network Fees**: Consider costs on mainnet vs testnet

### Operational Considerations
- **Time Zones**: All timestamps are UTC
- **Vote Privacy**: Hashes must not be reversible
- **Scalability**: Consider gas limits for large elections
