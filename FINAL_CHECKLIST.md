## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

### Immediate Actions (Ready Now):
1. **✅ Supabase Environment Variables** - Already configured
2. **✅ Edge Functions** - Ready to deploy with new contract address
3. **✅ Frontend Integration** - ABI available in `contracts/abi.json`

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Deploy to Polygon Mainnet**:
   ```bash
   # Update .env with mainnet RPC and real private key
   npm run deploy:polygon
   ```

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - Consider professional smart contract audit
   - Use multi-sig wallet for contract ownership
   - Implement additional access controls if needed

3. **Monitoring & Maintenance**:
   - Set up transaction monitoring
   - Configure gas price alerts
   - Monitor contract events for anomalies
